runepkg is mostly stable for what it does in its current functionality.
runepkg -i pkgname-version auto completes
ruenpkg -i somedir/pkgname-version auto completes
multiple interleaved commands dont get executed in the order of the command though like:
runepkg -i pkgname-version --print-config

i wanted consistant execution of interleaved commands in the right order for commands like:
runepkg -r pkgname-version -i pkgname-version.deb --print-config
should be executed in order...
