ok grok my solution for carried over pkglist auto complete on gnu linux.

create 2 files named pkglist.bin, pkglist.txt.
create a file in /etc/runepkg/ config_dir if you have too or user's specific runepkg ~/.runepkg config_dir
its in cascading config system.
runepkg runs and collects what pkglist info it can.
create runepkg_completions in source tree.
then bash-completion takes care of rest.
i want to load entire pkglist like its a built in command option that automaticly
auto completes when interleaved cammands are used.
possible?
