## Running Tests

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Comprehensive testing (recommended for releases)
make test-comprehensive

# Individual test suites
make test-simple      # Quick development tests
make test-memory      # Memory safety tests  
make test-security    # Security hardening tests

# Test utilities
make clean-tests      # Clean all test artifacts
make test-help       # Show available test targets
```

### Test Output Example

```
=== Memory Leak Test ===
[VERBOSE] Hash table created with size 17
[VERBOSE] Package 'test-package-0' added to hash table.
[VERBOSE] Package 'test-package-1' added to hash table.
...
[VERBOSE] All packages removed from hash table
[VERBOSE] Hash table destroyed and memory freed.
PASS: All packages removed from hash table

=== Comprehensive Test Summary ===
Total tests: 63
Failed tests: 0
Passed tests: 63
Success rate: 100.0%
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED! Memory model and security features are robust.
```

### Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed for automated CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# CI/CD validation script
make clean-all
make test-comprehensive
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ All tests passed - Ready for deployment"
else
    echo "❌ Tests failed - Deployment blocked"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Test Development

### Adding New Tests

1. **Memory Tests**: Add to `memory_test.c`
   - Use `test_assert()` macro for validation
   - Include verbose logging with `runepkg_log_verbose()`
   - Test both success and failure conditions

2. **Security Tests**: Add to `security_test.c`
   - Use `security_assert()` macro for validation
   - Test attack scenarios and edge cases
   - Validate error codes and messages

3. **Simple Tests**: Add to `simple_memory_test.c`
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Keep tests fast and lightweight
   - Use for development feedback

### Test Macros

```c
// Memory test validation
test_assert(condition, "Test description");

// Security test validation  
security_assert(condition, "Security test description");

// Custom assertions with detailed output
if (condition) {
    printf("PASS: Test description\n");
} else {
    printf("FAIL: Test description\n");
    test_failures++;
}
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Build System Integration

The testing framework is fully integrated with the Makefile build system:

- **C-only compilation**: Tests avoid C++ dependencies for faster builds
- **Unified logging**: All tests use the same logging infrastructure  
- **Clean separation**: Test code is isolated from production code
- **Parallel builds**: Test suites can be built independently

### Memory Safety

All tests run with:
- **Leak detection**: Memory allocations are tracked and verified
- **Boundary checking**: Buffer operations are validated
- **Null pointer safety**: All pointer operations are checked
- **Thread safety**: Concurrent operations are tested

### Security Focus

Security tests specifically validate:
- **Attack prevention**: Path traversal, buffer overflow, injection attempts
- **Input sanitization**: All external input is validated
- **Resource limits**: Memory and resource consumption is bounded
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure under attack conditions

## Debugging Test Failures

### Memory Test Failures
```bash
# Run with verbose output
make test-memory

# Check for specific errors
grep "FAIL\|ERROR" test_output.log

# Use memory debugging tools
valgrind --leak-check=full ./memory_test
```

### Security Test Failures
```bash
# Run individual security tests
make test-security

# Check attack simulation results
grep "SECURITY FAIL" test_output.log

# Validate error handling
grep "ERROR:" test_output.log
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Memory Management**: 100% coverage of allocation/deallocation paths
- **Security Functions**: 100% coverage of defensive programming functions
- **Error Conditions**: All error paths tested and validated
- **Attack Scenarios**: Common attack vectors simulated and blocked
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and limit testing

## Release Validation

Before any release, the following validation must pass:

1. ✅ `make test-comprehensive` returns 0 (100% pass rate)
2. ✅ No memory leaks detected in any test suite
3. ✅ All security tests pass without warnings
4. ✅ Build system produces no warnings or errors
5. ✅ Clean builds work correctly (`make clean-all && make`)

**Current Status: ✅ ALL VALIDATION CRITERIA MET**
